**Axiom Rehabilitation**

Axiom Rehabilitation, formerly known as Outpatient Homecare Rehab, was established in 1998 by Physical Therapist and Lymphedema Specialist, Deborah Moura. The organization provides outpatient physical therapy services in the home and offers home health therapy staffing. Owned, operated, and managed by therapists, Axiom is committed to being value-driven and enhancing lives together.

Axiom offers a comprehensive healthcare staffing service, ranging from permanent placement to per diem home health staffing. With over 20 years of experience, they are equipped to handle any staffing needs. For healthcare organizations, Axiom maintains a vetted network of home health providers, ensures zero wait time, provides ongoing reporting to referring physicians or specialists, coordinates patient care, and offers full-desk staffing solutions. These efforts lead to a decreased average length of stay in hospitals and prove more cost-efficient than traditional treatment methods.

For patients, Axiom provides several benefits including a decreased chance of rehospitalization, discounted rates on compression garments and bandages, and access to specialists trained in both lymphedema and wound care. Patients also experience a reduced likelihood of emergency department visits, receive ongoing support and education, and can remain independent and in their homes longer.

Axiom's mission is to enhance the community by restoring and improving the quality of life for their clients, patients, and the community, one interaction at a time. They achieve this by being radically transparent, authentic in their relationships, innovative in their approach, and by identifying underserved communities. Axiom values relationships and strives to make a positive impact with each interaction.

For referrals, Axiom offers a straightforward process. Referral information can be communicated via phone at (407) 494-0644, faxed to the same number, or emailed to Referrals@Axiomrehab.com. They are located at 1180 Spring Centre South Blvd. Ste 225, Altamonte Springs, FL 32701, and can be reached at info@axiomrehab.com for general inquiries.
